# UoB Java assignments for the year 2019

These are solutions to all (past the deadline) java assignments that were given. Use `./compile_and_run.sh folder ClassName` to compile and run each assingmnet. There is some class re-use, so other classes might need to be compiled first (`./compile.sh folder ClassName`).
